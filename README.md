## Glad to see you here! &nbsp;

As a software engineering student with a passion for developing innovative solutions, I have gained experience in a variety of programming languages, . I have honed my skills in software development, database design, data structures, and algorithm analysis through coursework and internships. With the ability to quickly learn new technologies, I am constantly seeking to improve my understanding of emerging technologies and industry trends.

Along with my technical skills, I possess excellent communication and social skills, as well as leadership experience through leading and volunteering in school projects. Fluent in Arabic, English, and Hebrew.

I am excited to bring my knowledge and enthusiasm to a dynamic team that values collaboration, creativity, and innovation in solving complex problems.
